       "[\"The document discusses the nutritional composition of red meat, highlighting its benefits such as being an excellent source of high-quality protein, vitamins (B12, niacin, B6), minerals (iron, zinc, phosphorus), and omega-3 fatty acids. It notes that lean red meats are generally low in fat and sodium and contain various bioactive substances. The article, authored by Assoc Prof Peter G. Williams, was published in 2007 in the journal Nutrition & Dietetics. It is part of the University of Wollongong's open access repository.\",\n",
       " \"Lean red meats are a rich source of high-quality protein, essential vitamins (B12, niacin, B6), and minerals (iron, zinc, phosphorus). They provide beneficial omega-3 fats and various antioxidants while being low in fat and sodium. The FSANZ defines meat broadly, including various animals but excluding kangaroo and eggs. In Australia, 'red meat' refers specifically to meat from cattle, sheep, and goats. Processed meat contains at least 30% meat and has undergone preservation methods other than freezing.\",\n",
       " 'Red meat is a significant source of high-quality protein and essential micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals necessary for health. It contains a variety of fats, including omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, and has shown a trend towards leaner cuts in recent years. Lean red meat generally has low fat, moderate cholesterol, and high protein content. \\n\\nIn terms of nutrient composition, beef, veal, lamb, and mutton are all rich in protein (20-36g per 100g), with mutton being particularly nutrient dense. These meats provide over 25% of the recommended dietary intake (RDI) for several nutrients including niacin, vitamins B6 and B12, phosphorus, zinc, and iron, and also contribute to riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and selenium. The protein in red meat is highly digestible and contains all essential amino acids, with a Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) of about 0.9, indicating high protein quality compared to plant sources.',\n",
       " 'The text discusses the fat content and nutritional profile of red meat in Australia, highlighting significant variations in separable fat across different cuts, with a decline in fat content observed over the years due to breeding, feeding practices, and butchery techniques. Trimmed lean red meats are generally low in fat (<7%) and moderate in cholesterol. The saturated fat content in Australian beef and lamb is less than that of unsaturated fats, with specific fatty acids like palmitic and stearic acids being predominant. Pasture-fed beef offers better omega-3 fatty acid levels compared to grain-fed beef. Trans fatty acids are present in low amounts in red meat. Choline and various vitamins, particularly B12, riboflavin, and niacin, are significant nutrients found in red meat, although vitamin D levels are low. Overall, red meat is a key dietary source of long-chain omega-3 fats in Australia.',\n",
       " \"Beef and lamb are rich sources of minerals, particularly iron and zinc, providing at least 25% of daily adult requirements per 100g. The iron in meat is primarily haem-iron, which is well absorbed, and meat protein enhances iron absorption. Zinc absorption is also higher from animal protein compared to plant sources, with vegetarians possibly needing 50% more zinc. Red meats contribute over 20% of the recommended daily intake (RDI) of selenium per 100g, though selenium levels can vary based on animal diet and sampling time. Lean meats are low in sodium, with a potassium/sodium ratio exceeding five. Copper content varies by meat type, with higher levels in mutton compared to beef and lamb.\\n\\nAdditionally, meat contains bioactive compounds such as taurine, L-carnitine, and conjugated linoleic acid (CLA), which may have health benefits. Taurine, abundant in meat, may be conditionally essential during lactation and immune challenges. L-carnitine helps transport fatty acids for energy production, with higher levels found in sheep muscle. CLA, linked to antioxidant properties and potential obesity control, varies in content based on several factors. Endogenous antioxidants like carnosine and anserine are significant in meat, with carnosine levels notably high in beef and lamb. Other antioxidants, including coenzyme Q10 and glutathione, also contribute to meat's nutritional profile, with glutathione levels in red meat being substantially higher than in poultry and fish.\",\n",
       " 'Creatine, found primarily in red meat at about 350mg per 100g, is important for muscle energy metabolism and can enhance performance when supplemented in higher doses (up to 15g/day). Organ meats, except for tripe, are rich in vitamin B12 and other nutrients: liver is particularly high in protein, iron, zinc, and vitamins A and folate; kidney has protein, thiamin, and riboflavin; heart offers iron and zinc; while brains and tripe lack significant nutrients. All organ meats are high in cholesterol and generally low in sodium. The Australian Guide to Healthy Eating suggests 1-2 servings of meat or equivalents daily. Compared to vegetarian protein sources, red meat (especially lean beef and lamb) is superior in protein, zinc, niacin, omega-3 fats, vitamin B6, selenium, and is the only source of vitamin B12, while being lower in sodium and total fat than alternatives like eggs, cheese, and nuts.',\n",

      "Red meat contains high biological value protein and important micronutrients that are needed for good health throughout life. It also contains a range of fats, including essential omega-3 polyunsaturated fats. Recent analyses have shown that there has been a significant trend to leaner cuts of meat over the past two decades [3]. While the nutritional composition will vary somewhat according to breed, feeding regimen, season and meat cut, in general lean red meat has a low fat content, is moderate in cholesterol and rich in protein and many essential vitamins and minerals.\n",

      "Table 1 presents the typical nutrient composition of samples of fat-trimmed Australian red meat, based on recent analyses of national retail samples [4-6] and compares this to the new Australian recommended dietary intakes [7]. While there are some differences between the four meats, in general lean red meat is a particularly good source of protein, niacin, vitamin B6, vitamin B12, phosphorus, zinc and iron, with 100g providing more than 25% RDI of these nutrients. It also provides more than 10% RDI of riboflavin, pantothenic acid, and selenium. Of the four meats, mutton is particularly nutrient dense, and the richest source of thiamin, vitamins B6 and B12, phosphorus, iron and copper.\n",
      "\n",
      "Protein and amino acids\n",
      "\n",
      "Raw red muscle meat contains around 20-25g protein/100g. Cooked red meat contains 28- 36g/100g, because the water content decreases and nutrients become more concentrated during cooking. The protein is highly digestible, around 94% compared to the digestibility of 78% in beans and 86% in whole wheat [8]. Protein from meat provides all essential amino acids (lysine, threonine, methionine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, leucine, isoleucine, valine) and has no limiting amino acids. Protein Digestibility Corrected Amino Acid Score (PDCAAS) is a method of evaluating the protein quality, with a maximum possible score of 1.0. Animal meats like beef have a score of approximately 0.9, compared to values of 0.5-0.7 for most plant foods [9]. The amino acid glutamic acid/glutamine is present in meat in the highest amounts (16.5%), followed by arginine, alanine, and aspartic acid.\n",

       "  'Minerals\\n\\nBeef and lamb meat are among the richest sources of the minerals iron and zinc, with 100g providing at least one quarter of daily adult requirements (Table 1). The iron in meat is mostly haem-iron which is well absorbed, and meat protein also appears to enhance the absorption of iron from meat. Similarly, absorption of zinc from a diet high in animal protein is greater than from plant foods, and the requirements for zinc may be as much as 50% higher for vegetarians [7]. Red meats are also good sources of selenium, providing over 20% RDI per 100g serve, although it is likely that selenium values in meat will be significantly affected by where animals feed and the time of the year of sampling. Lean meat is low in sodium with a potassium/sodium ratio of greater than five. The copper content in raw lean cuts range from 0.055 to 0.190mg/100g in beef and veal, 0.090 to 0.140mg/100g in lamb, and 0.190 to 0.240mg/100g in mutton, all significantly higher than values reported in British meat [20].\\n\\n2.2 Meat based bioactive compounds\\n\\nIn addition to the traditional essential nutrients with defined requirements, there are a number of meat-based bioactive substances that have been studied for their potential beneficial effects [21].\\n\\nTaurine\\n\\nAn amino acid in meat of particular interest is taurine. Meat is rich in taurine (110mg/100g in lamb and 77mg/100g in beef) [22] and meat is the most abundant dietary source. While taurine can be derived from methionine and cysteine metabolism, there have been suggestions that it should be considered a conditionally essential amino acid during lactation, during times of immune challenge, and may offer protection against oxidative stress [23, 24].\\n\\nCarnitine\\n\\nL-carnitine (beta-hydroxy-gamma-trimethyl amino butyric acid) transports long chain fatty acids across the inner mitochondrial membranes to produce energy during exercise. Although not an essential nutrient, needs appear to be increased during pregnancy and after strenuous exercise and a recommended intake of 24-81mg/d has been proposed [25]. It is found in skeletal muscle and is particularly abundant in sheep muscle at up to 209mg/100g [26] and in beef at around 60mg/100g [27].\\n\\nConjugated linoleic acid (CLA)\\n\\nCLA has antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties and may also play a role in the control of obesity [28]. Since rumen bacteria convert linoleic acid to CLA, it is most abundant in the fat of ruminant animals, although CLA is also present in partially hydrogenated vegetable oils. The CLA content of meat is affected by several factors including breed, age and food composition [29]. It is mostly present in the fat component of red meat (approximately 1g/100g) but is also found in the muscle meat: 10-46mg/100g in raw meat and 30-100mg/100g in cooked red meat [17].\\n\\n4\\n\\nEndogenous antioxidants\\n\\nSeveral endogenous compounds (including ubiquinone, glutathione, lipoic acid, spermine, carnosine, anserine) have been studied in skeletal muscle [30]. Both carnosine and anserine are antioxidative histidyl dipeptides and the most abundant antioxidants in meat. Carnosine is present at around 365mg/100g in beef [31] and 400mg/100g in lamb [22]. Because carnosine is absorbed into the plasma intact, it is a potentially important dietary antioxidant [32]. Coenzyme Q10 (ubiquinone) also has antioxidant properties and supplements have shown beneficial effects in some studies [33]. Levels in meat are estimated to be around 2mg/100g in both beef and sheep meat [31]. Glutathione is a component of glutathione peroxidise enzymes which have an important antioxidant role in the body. It may also play a role in immune response and enhancing iron absorption by contributing to the ‘meat factor’. Glutathione levels in red meat are estimated to be 12-26mg/100g in beef [34] and most meats contain approximately twice the level of glutathione of poultry and up to ten times the content found in fish.',\n",
       "  'Key Points\\n\\nLean red meats are:\\n\\ne Anexcellent source of high biological value protein, vitamin B12, niacin, vitamin B6, iron, zinc and phosphorus\\n\\ne A source of long-chain omega-3 polyunsaturated fats, riboflavin, pantothenic acid, selenium and possibly also vitamin D\\n\\ne Mostly low in fat and sodium\\n\\ne Sources of a range of endogenous antioxidants and other bioactive substances including taurine, carnitine, carnosine, ubiquinone, glutathione and creatine.\\n\\n1) What is meat?\\n\\nThe Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) Food Standard Code defines meat as ‘the whole or part of the carcass of any buffalo, camel, cattle, deer, goat, hare, pig, poultry, rabbit or sheep, slaughtered other than in a wild state, but does not include eggs, or foetuses’ [1]. This definition does not include kangaroo meat, which is now widely available for purchase in Australia and would be considered by most Australians as meat.\\n\\nCommonly people use ‘meat’ to refer only to meat flesh (skeletal muscle plus any attached connective tissue or fat), but the FSANZ definition also includes offal (ie, meat other than meat flesh, including brain, heart, kidney, liver, pancreas, spleen, thymus, tongue and tripe) although it excludes bone and bone marrow.\\n\\nIn Australia, the term ‘red meat’ is used by the meat industry to refer to meat from cattle, sheep and goat (ie beef, veal, lamb, mutton and goat meat). It does not include meat from pigs (eg, pork, bacon, ham) or kangaroo, nor less common game meats like buffalo and camel, although nutrient composition of some of these products is now becoming available [2]. Purchased red meat usually consists of both lean tissue (muscle) and fat tissue, which can be either distributed throughout the muscle as marbling (internal fat) or surrounding the muscle meat as selvage or external fat. In trimmed lean meat, it is usually the external fat only that is removed.\\n\\nProcessed meat means a product containing no less than 30% meat, that has undergone a method of preservation other than freezing, and includes manufactured meat and cured and/or dried meat flesh (eg, sausages, salami, canned meats).',\n",

       " 'question': 'What is Meat based bioactive compounds',\n",
       " 'response': 'Meat-based bioactive compounds refer to various substances found in meat that have potential beneficial effects on health, beyond the traditional essential nutrients. Some of these compounds include:\\n\\n1. **Taurine**: An amino acid abundant in meat, particularly in lamb (110mg/100g) and beef (77mg/100g). It may offer protective benefits during lactation and immune challenges and is thought to help against oxidative stress.\\n\\n2. **Carnitine**: A compound that helps transport long-chain fatty acids across mitochondrial membranes for energy production. While not an essential nutrient, its needs may increase during pregnancy and after strenuous exercise. It is found in higher amounts in sheep muscle (up to 209mg/100g) and around 60mg/100g in beef.\\n\\n3. **Conjugated Linoleic Acid (CLA)**: Known for its antioxidant and immunomodulatory properties, CLA may play a role in obesity control. It is found in the fat of ruminant animals and is affected by factors like breed and diet.\\n\\n4. **Endogenous Antioxidants**: These include compounds like carnosine, anserine, ubiquinone (coenzyme Q10), and glutathione, which are studied for their antioxidant properties. For example, carnosine is present at around 365mg/100g in beef and 400mg/100g in lamb, and it may act as a dietary antioxidant. Glutathione levels in red meat are estimated to be 12-26mg/100g in beef.\\n\\nThese bioactive compounds contribute to the nutritional value of meat and may offer additional health benefits.'}"
